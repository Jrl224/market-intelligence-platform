# Market Intelligence Platform - Setup Summary

## Current Status
Your platform is deployed and the code is ready. The issue you're seeing (empty data, "example data" messages) is because **no API keys are configured in Vercel**.

## Quick Fix (Total Cost: $0-5)

### Step 1: Get Free API Keys (10 minutes)

1. **NewsAPI** (FREE - 100/day)
   - https://newsapi.org/register
   - Sign up → Get key instantly

2. **Reddit** (FREE - unlimited)  
   - https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps
   - Create App → Choose "script" → Get ID & Secret

3. **YouTube** (FREE - 10,000 units/day)
   - https://console.cloud.google.com
   - Enable YouTube Data API v3 → Create API Key

4. **Alpha Vantage** (FREE - 25/day)
   - https://www.alphavantage.co/support/#api-key
   - Enter email → Get key

5. **OpenAI** ($5 minimum)
   - https://platform.openai.com
   - Needed for query expansion feature

### Step 2: Add to Vercel (2 minutes)

1. Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Click your project → Settings → Environment Variables
3. Add these:
```
NEWSAPI_KEY=your_key_here
REDDIT_CLIENT_ID=your_id_here
REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET=your_secret_here
YOUTUBE_API_KEY=your_key_here
ALPHA_VANTAGE_KEY=your_key_here
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

### Step 3: Redeploy (30 seconds)

1. Go to Deployments tab
2. Click "..." on latest → Redeploy
3. Wait for green checkmark

## What You'll Get

✅ **Working Features:**
- Real news articles (not "Invalid Date")
- Real Reddit discussions with sentiment
- Actual stock prices
- YouTube comment analysis
- Smart query expansion (finds competitors automatically)
- PDF exports with real data

❌ **Skipped (Too Expensive):**
- Twitter/X ($100/month)
- LinkedIn (requires partnership)

## Test Your Setup

After adding keys, try these searches:
- "Tesla stock" → Should show real TSLA price
- "AI trends" → Should show real news & Reddit posts
- "OxiClean" → Should identify Tide, Gain as competitors

## Troubleshooting

**Still seeing empty data?**
1. Check Vercel logs (Functions tab)
2. Make sure you clicked "Save" after adding each key
3. Did you redeploy after adding keys?

**"Invalid Date" in news?**
- You need NEWSAPI_KEY configured

**Sentiment showing 0/0/0?**
- You need Reddit API keys configured

## Files Created
- `FREE_API_GUIDE.md` - Detailed setup instructions
- `.env.local.example` - Shows which APIs are actually free

Your platform is technically working - it just needs API keys to show real data instead of falling back to mock data.
